# Yeskala_Time_Planner
This is Yeskala Time Planner, an AI Time Planner that was built to help school students and college students to manage their time well in the most simplisitic way possible. We first saw an initial problem that students, especiallyy the students in their senior years in school or even in college, were finding it really hard to manage their tasks in the day. This was causing them a lot of stress to deal with. This is the reason we thought that wouldnt an AI Time Planner manage the students time well, and the way it does that is very simple. Just enter your day plan in the text box and an entire plan of the day will be generated. You can also make it much quicker by adding pre-made tasks to the task library and selecting them. The AI can also be more personalized towards you by adding preferences and also adding reflections at the end of each day. You also get a coach note that tells you a entire summary of the entire day plan.
